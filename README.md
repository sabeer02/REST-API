# Spring Boot REST API with Swagger UI

This project is a Spring Boot-based REST API that serves as a backend for a product management system. It includes Swagger UI for easy documentation and testing of API endpoints.

## Technologies Used

- **Spring Boot:** A powerful and convention-over-configuration-based Java framework for building standalone and production-grade Spring-based applications.

- **Spring Data JPA:** A part of the larger Spring Data project, it makes it easy to implement JPA-based repositories.

- **Swagger UI:** An open-source tool for generating interactive API documentation. It allows developers to visualize and interact with the API's resources without having any of the implementation logic in place.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your machine.
- Maven for building and managing the project.
